1. In the following code, what are the final length values for array1, array2, 
array3, array4, and array5?

A. 

let array1 = [1, 2, undefined, 4];
// 4

let array2 = [1];
array2.length = 5;
// 5

let array3 = [];
array3[-1] = [1];
// 1
// WRONG. Index positions must be non-negative integers starting from 0. Negative and non-integer indexes don't get taken into account when determining an array's length.

let array4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array4.length = 3;
// 3

let array5 = [];
array5[100] = 3;
// 100
// WRONG. The length of array5 is 101. As already noted, the length is the highest index position that has a value, plus 1. In this case, the highest index position that has a value is 100, so the length is 101.
